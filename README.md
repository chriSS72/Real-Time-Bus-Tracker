# Real-Time-Bus-Tracker
It consists in connecting to MapBox GL using an API access token, providing bus stop coordinates, displaying a map, and updating the location based on the coordinates of the stops.

## How to run:
Download the compressed file containing all the files in the repository, extract it and open the index.hmtl file with a web browser. You may modify the content of the files depending on the desired outcome.

## Roadmap of future improvements:
Retrieve coordinates for the bus stops instead of having an static array with them.
